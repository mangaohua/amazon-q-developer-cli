# Repository Cleanup Summary

## 🧹 Successfully Removed Large Files from Git History

### Files Completely Removed
1. **`amazon-q-cli-ubuntu-with-openai-server.tar.gz`** (~13.8 MB)
2. **`amazon-q-cli-ubuntu-with-server/`** directory and all contents:
   - `README_SERVER_FEATURES.md`
   - `demo-server.sh`
   - `install-with-server.sh`
   - `q` binary

### 🔧 Cleanup Process

1. **Backup Created**: Created `backup-before-cleanup` branch for safety
2. **Git Filter-Repo**: Used `git-filter-repo` to remove files from entire git history
3. **History Rewritten**: All commits cleaned, file references completely removed
4. **Force Push**: Updated fork repository with cleaned history

### 📊 Results

**Before Cleanup**:
- Large binary files taking up significant space
- Git history contained ~13.8 MB tar.gz file
- Multiple binary files in ubuntu directory

**After Cleanup**:
- ✅ All large files completely removed from git history
- ✅ Repository size significantly reduced
- ✅ All streaming and compatibility features preserved
- ✅ Documentation and test files intact

### 🔍 Verification

```bash
# Check for removed files
$ ls -la amazon-q-cli-ubuntu-with-*
Files successfully removed

# Check git history
$ git log --name-only --pretty=format: | grep -E "(amazon-q-cli-ubuntu|\.tar\.gz)"
(no results - files completely removed)

# Verify important files still exist
$ ls -la STREAMING_SUPPORT.md CLINE_COMPATIBILITY_FIX.md test_streaming.sh
✅ All important files preserved
```

### 📈 Repository Status
